= Certificate Magic!

Certificate Magic! helps make it easy create and install certificates.

The process for creating a certificate is as follows:

1. run the create command to generate a CSR and encrypted private key
2. (IRL) get the certificate issued using your provider
3. run the install command with the certificate you get back from (2.)
4. (IRL) set up the certificate for your application and test it is working
5. run tidy to delete the temporary files

== Installing Certificate Magic!

Fetch the latest jar file from the releases section of this repo, as
well as the executable script to run the program. Instructions will
appear here.

== Examples

Create a new CSR for your domain, using your configured AWS profile

    cert-magic create -d www.example.com -p my-aws-profile

Create a CSR for a wildcard domain, specifying the region

    cert-magic create -d *.example.com -p my-profile -r eu-west-1

Install a certificate into AWS

    cert-magic install --certificate <path to cert> --chain <path to chain/bundle> -p aws-profile

Install a certificate into a second (different) AWS account

    cert-magic install --certificate <path to cert> --chain <path to chain/bundle> -p aws-profile --installProfile different-aws-profile

Delete the files associated with a domain (to clear up after
installation)

    cert-magic tidy -d www.example.com

== Commands

Here is a little more detail on each command

=== Create

This creates a keypair and certificate signing request for the given
domain. The private key is encrypted using AWS KMS and stored under
~/.certmagic in your home directory. The CSR is displayed (and also
saved to a file) so that you can send the CSR to a CA for signing.

=== Install

When you get your certificate back, use the install mode to validate
and upload your certificate into IAM. The private key will be
decrypted appropriately and installed alongside the certificate and
certificate chain.

If you are uploading the same certificate to multiple AWS accounts
you'll need to use the optional `installProfile` flag. This allows you
to specify a profile to use for the certificate installation.  You'll
still need to provide the same profile you used to create the
certificate so that the private key can be correctly decrypted. In
this way you can install the certificate in multiple accounts by
running the command with different install profiles provided.

=== List

List the private keys and CSRs that are outstanding.

=== Tidy

Deletes the files associated with a domain to remove any access to the
private key. This should be done after a domain is installed and has
been tested.
